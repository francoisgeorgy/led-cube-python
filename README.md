LED Cube - Python
=================

Checkout the [main repository](https://github.com/francoisgeorgy/led-cube) to get more information about the LED Cube.

Installation
------------

If you want to run the Rubik's Cube demo, see the dedicated chapter later on. 

### For development

    pip install --editable .
    pip install fastapi uvicorn 'uvicorn[standard]' bottle ifaddr segno

### In the Cube

    pip install --editable .
    pip install RPi.GPIO adafruit-blinka fastapi uvicorn 'uvicorn[standard]' bottle ifaddr segno

Rubik's Cube demo
-----------------

    pip install RubikTwoPhase

After having installed the `RubikTwoPhase` you have to generate some data which will be used to solve the cubes. 

Open a python interpreter and do :  

    import twophase.solver  as sv

This will create a `twophase` directory with pre-computed data files in it. About 70MB. 

This directory can be copied in the Raspberry Pi. This way you don't need to generate the data on the Raspberry itself.

For more details, see https://github.com/hkociemba/RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver.
